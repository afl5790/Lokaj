            <h2>Reading Response</h2>
            <p><strong>Topic:</strong>Data Brokers Discussion</p>
            <blockquote>
                "I learned a lot about the collection and sale of our personal information from this video. The amount of information corporations have about us, including where we live, what we buy, and even our health astonished me. The people/companies that gather our information from a variety of sources, such as websites, applications, and public records, and then market it to other businesses are called "Data brokers". What shocked me the most was how little control we have over this process. I had no idea how simple it is for someone to purchase our personal information without our awareness.

                This made me think about the idea of identity and how much of who we are is connected to our data. The video explains that these companies build profiles on us, which can include personal things, like our habits or even secrets. This is concerning because it seems like our identities are being reduced to marketable categories and numbers. How can we defend ourselves? Why isn't this being prevented by more regulation? All in all, it opened my eyes and helped me see how crucial it is to be mindful of what we post and how we interact online. "
