        <h2>Play My Twine Game</h2>
        <p>
            As part of my exploration into game design, I created a Twine-based interactive story
            called <strong>"One Step at a Time"</strong>. The game challenges players to make healthy, mindful choices across a typical day.

            For this project, I created a Twine game called <strong>One Step at a Time</strong>. 
            It is a choice-based interactive story where the player makes small daily decisions about their health, like what they are going to eat, whether they will sleep in or get up, and if they are going to scroll their phone or exercise. 
            The goal of the game is to show how little things we do every day can really add up and change how we feel. 
            You don't have to be perfect to remain healthy; you just have to be aware of your daily habits. 
            I wanted this game to feel realistic, especially for students trying to balance school, friends, and self-care.
            Initially, I felt nervous about using Twine because I had never made a game or used it in general before. 
            Once I became familiar with the structure, I started to enjoy it. 
            I learned how to connect passages and track variables that I created like energy, mood and sleep. 
            This made the game feel more dynamic because the player's decisions actually change their outcome in the ending. 
            I was also able to use some macros to change text color, show a hint, and had reminders, like "Remember to drink water," if needed. 
            There were some hard parts, like figuring out if all the links worked, and if the endings triggered appropriately, but once it worked, it was a great feeling.
            I edited the visuals of the game too. To do this, I inserted some custom CSS to add style to the background, text, and links. 
            I had already put my CSS styles in the CSS folder for my game, but at first they didn't look right because I realized it depended on where the HTML was saved in my folders. 
            Eventually I understood that "the path" of the CSS needs to be changed depending where the HTML file is, which I think is cool because it helped me better understand the organization of websites.
